However, the people of Normandy never really stopped making it and starting in 1986, France legally recognized the production and marketing of Pommeau de Normandie. The decree defines its process rules and guarantees the typicity of this aperitif. Today, Pommeau is exported in more than 20 countries.\n\nHow Its Made ...\n\nPommeau de Normandie is a blend made of three parts of fresh cider apple juice and one part of calvados. The appellation requires a minimum ageing of 14 months in oak barrels after the blend is made. However our Pommeau de Normandie is aged from three to four years. This extra ageing enables us to obtain a better balance with no apparent alcohol. We also take particular care in the choice of the apples used so as to obtain the perfect flavour, neither too sweet no too heavy. \n\nHow to Drink It ...\n\nPommeau de Normandie should be served chilled (8°to 10°C) in a tulip glass. Its apple aromas, fruit exuberance and moderate sweetness make it many people''s favoured aperitif. Before dinner, one can have it pure or in cocktails as a long drink with Champagne or even mixed with numerous spirits. An excellent match with many desserts, it also gives a delicious apple perfume to many dishes.

At the heart of our unique grain recipe base â€” used in both our vodka and gin â€” is the Yukon Gold potato. Grown by local farmers, it is a short-season, fresh-market vegetable, known to be a favorite of gourmet chefs for their nutty and buttery flavor. And when it comes to the water we use, our distillery is within sight of the mighty, glacier-fed Yukon river, made famous during the Klondike Gold Rush.\r\n\r\nWhat gives Yukon Shine Distillery products their exceptional character and flavour profile?\r\n\r\nYukon Shine has developed a unique source for its starch â€” combining Yukon Gold potatoes, Canadian rye, and malted barley. This combination gives our spirits their surprisingly different taste and aroma profiles. Most potato distillations use russet potatoes â€” or other inexpensive varieties â€” that are high in starch. Since Yukon Gold potatoes are the lowest in starch, more unique flavor compounds are captured during the distillation process. This results in a more viscous quality and a smooth, velvety spirit.\r\n\r\nIs your product really filtered over gold?\r\n\r\nYes, it is. First, we filter our spirits over a traditional charcoal filtration. Then, it passes at high pressure through a filter chamber filled with real Yukon gold nuggets. We are one of the few distilleries in the world to use gold, which has mineral properties that give our spirits a smooth, velvety texture and intense taste. The use of gold filtration not only adds important subtleties when used as a filter medium, but acts as an homage to our ancestral history of the Gold Rush and the spirit of the Yukon.\r\n\r\nWhat is quadruple distillation?\r\n\r\nThere are two stages to making great spirits: the fermentation of all of our locally sourced ingredients and the distillation process, which vaporizes it into alcohol.

Following their dreams of making premium wines from the Sierra Foothills, today Milliaire Winery has expanded to include the next generation of the Millier family and occupies over an 8,000 square foot winery with a dedicated barrel room and modern crush pad facility.\n\n<h2>About the Winemaker</h2>\nAfter 36 harvests, Steve Millier is still exploring, learning and most importantly, having fun in the winery. He graduated from Fresno State with a degree in enology (winemaking) in 1975. His drive to understand the whole of winemaking led him to pursue a second degree in viticulture (grape growing). He knows the science and art of winemaking and grape growing from the ground up. Steve is part alchemist, part artist and part farmer. The rest of us are fortunate to enjoy both his company and the fruit of his life''s work - great bottles of wine!\n\n<h2>About Our Vineyards</h2>\nWe label our wines "Vineyard Selections" because we are fortunate to have access to a variety of outstanding Foothill vineyards. We have worked with the same growers for thirty years and value their friendship and dedication to the quality fruit they produce. In the winery we continue that dedication to excellence, our wines are truly handmade! Only the finest grapes are chosen and minimally processed, using native yeasts and cellaring in French and American Oak barrels. This allows the unique characteristics of each vineyard to be expressed.'),

We are committed to making elegant Rhône-style wines that express the distinct qualities of our granitic soils and meticulously farmed, high elevation vineyards.\n\nMike’s great-great-great grandfather, James Skinner, was a Scottish miner who established and ran the original Skinner winery from 1861 through the early 1900’s. With the new Skinner Vineyards, we hope to weave our history with the bright future of the foothills, and unite our love of family, nature, food, and wine.'),

We focus solely on premium small-batch wines, and believe this allows us to craft wines which showcase the characteristics of each varietal. We focus on 3 whites and 3 reds: Riesling, Gewürztraminer, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir, Baco Noir and Cab Franc.\n\nCurrently, we have 6+ acres under vine and augment with hand-picked grapes from top-quality growers who manage their vineyards sustainably and crop their vines for low yields and greater fruit intensity.\n\nOur wines are made only in small batches - some as few as 25 cases (one barrel) at a time - and most available exclusively from our winery.'),

(11, 'reif.jpg', 'Reif Estate Winery', '<li>Ontario</li>', 'The Reif family tradition of winemaking began nearly half a millennium ago in the small winemaking town of Neustadt, located in the heart of the world renowned Rhine River Valley in Germany. In 1977, this tradition transcended to a new continent, when founder Ewald Reif purchased a plot of land on the fertile banks of the Niagara River.\n\nAfter carefully nurturing the land for six years, the potential of these young vineyards became evident when the doors of Reif Estate Winery officially opened in 1983.\n\nIn 1987, Klaus W. Reif took over the reins from his uncle Ewald, as the President and Winemaker after graduating from the world famous Geisenheim Institute in Germany with degrees in both Oenology and Viticulture. Having been born into a winemaking family with roots tracing back 12 generations Klaus'' future as a winemaker may have been preordained. In 1990, Klaus was joined by Roberto DiDomenico, a graduate of the University of Guelph with a specialized Honours Microbiology degree. Roberto''s winemaking philosophy of ''letting nature make wine'' married perfectly with Klaus''s belief that "...today we are growing wine in the vineyard."\n\nThese beliefs, partnered with a commitment to produce predominantly estate bottled wines from our 125 acre vineyard are the cornerstone of the quality and integrity of Reif Estate wines.'),

To others.... who ran the  village  Pastry and confisserie business… to  a renowned  chef  William from Tours, in the Loire valley, who taught at the Cordon Blue school of fine cuisine in Paris  to a line of great chefs.\n\nBlessed with a mother who prepared meals, using recipes and seasonings from  her artistic imagination, with an enthusiasm and  a passion that was infectious and a father, connoisseur and amateur of fine wines and brandies, who’s duty was to ensure the meal was well accompanied to attain its ultimate peak of flavors,\n\nIt was inevitable that I would develop the same love of gastronomic adventure, curiosity and appreciation for all those good things that are part of satisfying those overdeveloped senses of taste and smell.\n\nThese bon vivants addictions, in addition to several other self-satisfying hobbies, were financially supported through several careers at Queen’s university, the RCMP and in Real Estate.\n\nI am not a Certified Sommelier! Only a self-certification from the school of life with a Major  in Gourmand and a Minor in Gastronomy with experiences in adventure and exploration of fine cuisine and its accompaniments!\n\nManuela’s origins are from Seixo D’ansaeis , the heart of the Douro Valley,  and the birthplace of PORT wine  in Portugal. Her family has owned vineyards and worked in viticulture for many generations thus providing us with privileged contact opportunities to sample many excellent wines and select only the best quality to import to Canada.\n\nSince my first visit to the Douro, I have fallen in love with the Douro winemaking region, these most beautiful vineyards in the world, declared a World Heritage Site in 2001.\n\nAlthough the Douro is one of the world''s oldest demarcated wine regions, dating back to 1756, the international reputation of its table wines began to take off in the 1990s, when producers started to move away from the centuries-old reliance on port wine  and British control,  to turn out quality dry reds and whites that are quickly gaining international recognition.\n\nManuela and I are very passionate about these excellent wines and have travelled to Portugal to visit the vineyards, meet the winemakers who are so proud and passionate in their production.\n\nThe price /quality are still excellent for those wines that are yet to be discovered.  This is why we decided that the time was opportune to specialize in wines from Portugal and particularly the Douro valley to import and present these great wines for our Canadian clients.'),
