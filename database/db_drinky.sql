We have gone through a vigorous process to have our plant audited and the alcohol products being produced to be Certified Gluten-Free. Most auditing programs only test the final product for gluten (regardless of what it is made from) and have certain parameters they follow â€“ such as under 20ppm or 10ppm. Our audit is unique for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nThe alcohol base CANNOT be a gluten grain to begin with\r\nWe cannot add any gluten purposely in our mix at any stage of the process\r\nEmployees and Management have been versed in gluten and understand how to prevent cross contamination. Policies and procedures are changed in the plant to reflect this\r\nWe minimize (as much as humanly possible) to reduce any cross contamination of gluten within the plant\r\nThe batch is tested to make sure it complies with all government standards when it comes to gluten free claims\r\nIf any of the above is not adhered to, this results in a failure\r\nThis audit has been endorsed by the Canadian Celiac Association and the National Foundation for Celiac Awareness in the United States of America. We are able to add the â€˜Mark of Trustâ€™ to our alcohol products so that celiac/gluten intolerant consumers know we have done everything possible to provide a safe, gluten free alcohol product. This audit is one of the toughest when it comes to becoming certified in the industry.\r\n\r\nMagic Moments Vodka is made from 100% non-GMO wild rice in India.  It is triple distilled at the correct temperature and filtered 15 times!  It is the #1 selling vodka in India and #19 in the world according to Forbes.  There are no artificial colours or preservatives.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a special order product and may take 8-12 weeks to deliver.', 'Magic Moments (Radico Khaitan) India'),

Well-balanced leaning towards the malt side with hints of honey, a citrus dryness with a light and clean finish.\r\n\r\nInternational Bitterness Unit: 37\r\n\r\nâ€œLion Grass... is a blonde ale that has been flavoured with organic lemongrass and dandelion leaves.\r\n\r\nâ€œPours a cheery gold colour with a fluffy off-white head made up of tiny bubbles. Nose is very green and herbaceous with a distinct lemon scent and a hint of lemon bread. First sip gives us sweet lemon and lemon curd, with a chicory/coffee note from the dandelions. There is a slight herbal bitterness that tastes similar to a frisee salad with a citrus dressing. Finish brings out a touch of barley and bread before going into a tangy lemon zest aftertaste. The beer tastes very green, lots of leafiness to it fresh and bright (a nice change from all of the heavy stouts and ales I have been tasting lately).\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is also a very wine-like feel to it. I get a nice grapey taste with the citrus and there are moments I feel like I am tasting a sauvignon blanc or a light riesling. Aeration brings out a good hit of malt, tangy sweet and dark malt sugars, and a hint of caramel right at the back.\r\n\r\nâ€œWell, thatâ€™s a different, interesting, and very refreshing beer. It has a lot going on in the flavour department while still being light. You definitely need to get one of these in you...â€', 'Highlander Brew Co. Ontario');
